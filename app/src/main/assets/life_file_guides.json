If we choose to buy clothes at the cheapest prices, then someone else will be forced to make those clothes for us and be paid very little for it is that tar? is that justice? if we just sit silent and don't speak out on behalf of the billions of people in our world who are oppressed, can we really say we aren't part of the problem?\n\nThe world God created and intended us to live in was one of complete and perfect justice.

But Jim Elliot felt God calling him to Ecuador to share the Gospel with the Aucas. Only one missionary had\n\never gone: a Jesuit priest who, in 1667, was murdered at his jungle outpost. Jim didn't let history stop him from what he knew God wanted. \"My going to Ecuador is God's counsel,\"\n\nJim wrote in his diary,\n\nSo Jim and four other missionaries left their families and boarded the ship for Ecuador. They built a camp in Auca territory and began trying to befriend the Aucas. They would fly over their village in a small aeroplane, drop gifts and call out to the Indians in the Auca language.\n\nOn 6 January 1956, they finally befriended one Auca, a young man they called \"George\". Now, they hoped.\n\nthey could make more contact with the tribe. That weekend, the Aucas attacked killing all the missionaries, including Jim Elliot. But that wasn't the end of the story. Jim's wife, Elisabeth, refused to let the murder of her husband\n\nkeep her from following God's call to Ecuador. She and other missionaries returned to Auca territory.\n\nLess than three years later, Elisabeth wrote: \"Today I sit in a tiny leaf-thatched hut... In another\"\n\nleaf house, just three metres away, sit two of the seven men who killed my husband.\"\n\nJim Elliot followed God's will, with seemingly tragic consequences. But God was at work even when his plan was difficult to see. And the missionary effort, started by Jim Elliot and continued by Elisabeth, prospered. Abram also left everything he knew to follow God to an unknown place. Read about his faith in Genesis 12:1-9.\n\nIn what ways was Jim Elliot's call similar to Abram's call in the passage?

It originates from the Egyptians who believed that the vein of that finger travelled directly to the heart. This belief was taken up by the Greeks when they conquered Egypt, and from them passed onto the Romans, who called this vein the veria amoris, which is Latin for \"the vein of love\". So, by wearing rings on the fourth finger of their left hands, a married couple symbolically declare their eternal love for each other.\n\nOf course, every ring will symbolise something very individual from person to person. Who the ring was given by, the memories it triggers, how beautiful it is all these things add up to making the humble wedding ring a very symbolic item. So, you can understand why the exchanging of the rings in a marriage service is such a big deal. When a man and woman promise before God to love one another, they want the rings to represent the relationship they'll have.\n\nRead Genesis 17:1-10. God is talking about a promise between him and Abraham and all his descendants. God also asks Abraham to do something as a symbol of the promise between them.\n\nWhat was God asking the Israelites to do to symbolise their part of the promise?

The popular kods had it so easy-everyone wanted to be like them and the opposite sex wanted to be with them! Never was this truer than for the lads in the year 11 rock band as they sang the classic rock song \"it's so easy, when everybody's tryin' to please me to a star-struck crowd of teenage girls. So Mark did what any self-respecting wannabe would do-he leamed to play the electric guitar and joined a band!\n\nAfter a few years he had become a fine guitarist, graduated from music college and enjoyed the populanty and prestige of touring the UK with a band. At his peak, God challenged Mark to serve him with his music and give up his ambitions of fame and fortune. Over the next few years, Mark took the Gospel into schools colleges and universities all over Europe as part of a band who gave their testimonies and preached the Gospel at shows\n\nMark never earned much money, never achieved the fame he'd once dreamt of and never gained any critical acclaim for his music, but had the far greater joy of knowing that God had used him to bring many young people to Jesus and encouraged countless others in their faith.\n\nRead 1 Corinthians 3:1-23\n\nThe Corinthians were arguing over who was a better wader and evangelist, Paulo Apollos How does this pastage show us t this is foolish? What does this passage tell us is t important than popularity?\n\nConsider...\n\nwhether you have any special talents or pills that you could use for God rather than your own popularity: Why not chat to a church leader or youth leader about how you could use them in church?\n\nwhether you try hard to be popular. Ask God to show you that he created you to be uniquely you, not to\n\ntry and be someone you're not\n\nFor more, see...\n\n-Proverbs 23:15-21 610)\n\n1 Corinthians 12:12-27 (p.1231)\n\n+ Daniel 1:1-21 (p.833)\n\nPhilippians 2:1-11 0 1282)",
